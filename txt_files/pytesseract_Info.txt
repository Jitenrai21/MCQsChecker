pytesseract is just a Python wrapper â€” it sends commands to the actual Tesseract-OCR engine, which does the heavy lifting of recognizing text in images. Without the engine installed, pytesseract has nothing to connect to and will raise errors.

On Windows:
Download the installer from Tesseract Releases

Run the installer.

Add the install path (e.g., C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR) to your system PATH.

In your Python code, you may need to specify the path like this:

pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'

.\env\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install pytesseract
