Workflow Overview
Step-by-Step Process
1. Preprocessing the Image
Convert to grayscale

Apply Gaussian blur (to remove noise) ---> Not Included.

Use adaptive threshold or binary threshold

Detect edges using Canny edge detection

2. Detect Paper/Contours
Find the largest rectangular contour (outer border of the MCQ sheet)

Apply perspective transform to warp it into a top-down view

3. Segment Answer Bubbles
Divide the image into predefined grid zones (based on number of questions)

For each question row, segment the 4 options (A to D)

Apply threshold + count non-zero pixels (or use circle detection) to identify the darkest (filled) bubble

4. Compare with Answer Key
Store correct answers in a list/dictionary

Compare detected responses with correct answers

Compute the score

5. (Optional) Extract Info
OCR the top fields (Name, ID, etc.) using pytesseract (optional if you want automation there too)

6. Display Results
Show individual question feedback

Final score

Optional: Highlight correct/incorrect bubbles in color
